STEP-BY-STEP EXPLANATION
🔹 Step 1: Multivariate Time Series Data Generation
What is done?
A complex multivariate dataset is created with 5 correlated features
Each feature represents a sensor reading
Dataset contains 1500 time steps
Includes:
Seasonality (sine & cosine waves)
Trend
Random noise
Why is this needed?
Real-world time series data (weather, stock, sensors) is multivariate
Deep learning models perform better with large and correlated datasets
Summary
✔ Created realistic time-series data suitable for deep learning forecasting
🔹 Step 2: Data Normalization (Scaling)
What is done?
Used MinMaxScaler
Scaled input features and target values to range 0–1
Why is this needed?
LSTM models are sensitive to scale
Improves:
Training stability
Faster convergence
Better accuracy
Summary
✔ Ensured all features contribute equally to model learning
🔹 Step 3: Sequence Creation (Supervised Learning Format)
What is done?
Converted time series into input-output sequences
Input window = 30 past time steps
Output horizon = 5 future steps
Example
Copy code

Input  : t1 → t30
Output : t31 → t35
Why is this needed?
LSTM learns patterns from past sequences
Enables multi-horizon forecasting
Summary
✔ Transformed raw data into model-ready sequences
🔹 Step 4: Train-Test Split (Time-Aware)
What is done?
Used 80% data for training
Used 20% data for testing
Maintained temporal order (no shuffling)
Why is this needed?
Time series cannot be randomly shuffled
Prevents data leakage
Summary
✔ Ensured realistic and valid model evaluation
🔹 Step 5: Encoder LSTM
What is done?
Encoder LSTM processes past time steps
Outputs hidden states for each time step
Why is this needed?
Captures:
Long-term dependencies
Temporal relationships
Forms the memory of past data
Summary
✔ Encoder learns historical patterns from multivariate inputs
🔹 Step 6: Attention Mechanism
What is done?
Trainable Attention Layer calculates:
Importance of each past time step
Produces:
Context vector
Attention weights
Why is this needed?
Not all past data is equally important
Attention helps the model focus on relevant time steps
Benefits
Improves accuracy
Improves interpretability
Summary
✔ Attention highlights which historical values influence predictions most
🔹 Step 7: Decoder LSTM (Multi-Horizon Forecasting)
What is done?
Context vector is repeated for future steps
Decoder LSTM predicts 5 future time points
Why is this needed?
Enables sequence-to-sequence prediction
Useful for real-world forecasting (next hours/days)
Summary
✔ Decoder generates multiple future predictions at once
🔹 Step 8: Baseline Model (Without Attention)
What is done?
Implemented a simple LSTM Encoder–Decoder
No attention layer used
Why is this needed?
To compare performance
To prove the effectiveness of Attention
Summary
✔ Baseline provides fair comparison for evaluation
🔹 Step 9: Model Training
What is done?
Trained both models for:
15 epochs
Batch size = 32
Used validation split
Why is this needed?
Allows models to learn patterns
Validation checks overfitting
Summary
✔ Models trained effectively using standard deep learning practices
🔹 Step 10: Model Evaluation
Metrics Used
MAE – Mean Absolute Error
RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error
MAPE – Mean Absolute Percentage Error
Why these metrics?
Commonly used in time series forecasting
Measure prediction accuracy
Result
✔ Attention model performs better than baseline
Summary
✔ Attention improves forecasting accuracy
🔹 Step 11: Attention Weight Visualization
What is done?
Extracted attention weights
Visualized using heatmap
What does it show?
Which time steps and features influenced prediction
Higher intensity = higher importance
Why is this important?
Improves model transparency
Useful for decision-making systems
Summary
✔ Model decisions are interpretable and explainable
